T-cell large granular lymphocytes (T-LGL) are a complex subset of immune cells that have garnered increasing attention in the context of human health and disease.  Characterised by their large size (12-15um) and the presence of cytotoxic granules, these lymphocytes play a pivotal role in the immune system's response to various challenges and span the delicate balance between protective immunity and pathological manifestations. 

In this study delve into the intricate relationship between T-LGL lymphoproliferative disorders and the broader landscape of chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and malignancy. By exploring the T cell repertoire, we aim to shed light on the nature of T-LGL expansions and their significance in the context of diseases like IBM.
